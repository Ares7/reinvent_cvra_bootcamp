# AWS Connected Vehicle Reference Architecture Bootcamp
During this Bootcamp, we'll take a deep dive into the AWS Connected Vehicle Reference Architecture. You'll install it, generate trip data from a simulated vehicle, and learn how the data can be accessed with various other AWS services. In this bootcamp, we'll access trip data using an Alexa skill.

#### Prerequisites
We'll assume that you have some basic knowledge of AWS services like IAM, DynamoDB, S3, IoT, etc., are comfortable using the AWS CLI, and have some knowledge of Python. You'll also need to prepare the following prior to the workshop: 
* Laptop running Windows or MacOS
* An AWS account with Administrator Access
* The AWS CLI, configured with an Administrator Access
